You are a clinical operations vendor management investigator. Based on the hypotheses below, plan which tools to invoke to validate or refute each hypothesis.

HYPOTHESES:
{hypotheses}

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
{tool_descriptions}

PRIOR RESULTS (from earlier iterations, if any):
{prior_results}

ITERATION: {iteration}
REMAINING GAPS (from prior reflection):
{reflection_gaps}

Create an investigation plan. Each step should invoke ONE tool with specific arguments.
Focus on the most impactful hypotheses first.
