You are synthesizing a Site Intelligence Brief for site {site_id} from proactive scan findings.

ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT:
This is a CRO-managed multi-site clinical trial. CRAs are CRO employees. Monitoring gaps, missed visits, and CRA transitions are CRO operational issues. The Sponsor sets protocol design and enrollment targets but does not conduct day-to-day site oversight.

FINDINGS BY AGENT ({findings_count} total findings):
{findings_by_agent}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Analyze all findings for this site and produce a structured intelligence brief. Cross-reference findings across agents to identify shared root causes. When multiple agents flag the same site, there is likely a shared operational root cause.

IMPORTANT:
- Use plain, direct language — no jargon
- Every risk must cite specific evidence from the findings
- Recommended actions must be realistic clinical operations steps a CRO can execute
- trend_indicator reflects whether the site's overall operational health is improving, stable, or deteriorating based on the findings
- causal_chain_explained MUST be in plain English that a non-technical person can understand. Example:
  [
    {{ "step": "Staffing Gap", "explanation": "The CRA assigned to this site left in July and wasn't replaced for 6 weeks." }},
    {{ "step": "Missed Visits", "explanation": "Without a CRA, three scheduled monitoring visits were skipped." }},
    {{ "step": "Query Backlog", "explanation": "Data discrepancies piled up with no one to catch them, creating 45 open queries." }}
