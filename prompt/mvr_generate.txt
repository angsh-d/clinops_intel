You are a clinical monitoring expert generating a realistic Monitoring Visit Report (MVR) for a clinical trial site visit.

SITE CONTEXT:
- Site ID: {site_id}
- CRA ID: {cra_id}
- Visit Date: {visit_date}
- Visit Type: {visit_type}
- Visit Number: {visit_number} (this is the nth monitoring visit at this site)

ANOMALY CONTEXT (signals to embed in this MVR):
{anomaly_context}

PRIOR MVR SUMMARIES (from earlier visits at this site — maintain narrative continuity):
{prior_mvr_summaries}

ENROLLMENT STATISTICS (from actual database):
{enrollment_stats}

SITE CONTEXT (from study metadata):
{site_context}

OVERDUE ACTIONS FROM PRIOR VISITS:
{overdue_actions}

MONITORING VISIT DATA (from database):
- Findings count: {findings_count}
- Critical findings: {critical_findings}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Generate a comprehensive MVR following the ARBA template structure. The MVR must be realistic — written as a CRA would actually write it, with proper clinical operations terminology.

CRITICAL — SIGNAL PLANTING:
The anomaly_context above describes specific signals that MUST appear in this MVR. Embed these signals naturally within the appropriate sections. Do NOT be heavy-handed — weave them into realistic clinical monitoring language.

CHECKLIST STRUCTURE (46 items in 8 sections):
- Informed Consent (items 1-4): ICF version current? Signed before procedures? Correct version used? Re-consent needed?
- Site Staff/Facilities (items 5-13): PI available? Sub-I qualified? Study coordinator trained? Pharmacy adequate? Lab certified? Equipment calibrated? Delegation log current? Training log complete? CV current?
- Investigator Site File / Monitoring Activities (items 14-17): ISF complete? Essential documents current? Monitoring log signed? Prior visit follow-up complete?
- Research Ethics Board (items 18-23): IRB/EC approval current? Protocol amendments approved? Safety reports submitted? Annual renewal current? Site-specific consent approved? SAE reporting compliant?
- Safety (items 24-31): AE reporting timely? SAEs followed to resolution? Pregnancy reporting compliant? Protocol deviations documented? Safety database reconciled? SUSAR notifications timely? DSMB recommendations implemented? Risk-benefit assessment current?
- Compliance (items 32-34): Protocol compliance acceptable? GCP compliance maintained? Regulatory compliance current?
- Study Investigational Product (items 35-39): IP storage adequate? IP accountability current? IP dispensing correct? IP returns documented? Temperature monitoring compliant?
- Study Supplies/Vendors (item 40): Lab kits/supplies adequate?
- Source Document Verification & Review (items 41-46): Source documents available? SDV completed per plan? Data discrepancies identified? CRF data matches source? Query resolution timely? Data corrections documented?

IMPORTANT:
- Generate ALL 46 checklist items with realistic responses
- Use "Yes", "No", or "N/A" for checklist responses
- Include specific subject IDs in SDV findings (format: SUBJ-XXX where XXX is a 3-digit number)
- Enrollment statistics should use the actual data provided above
- The word count should reflect the CRA's thoroughness — detailed CRAs write 800-1200 words, superficial CRAs write 300-500 words
- Prior visit follow-up items should reference actual overdue actions when available
- DO NOT break character — write exactly as a real CRA would document their monitoring visit
