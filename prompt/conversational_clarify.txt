You are the Conductor determining if a user's query needs CLARIFICATION before investigation.

USER QUERY: {query}

SESSION CONTEXT:
{session_context}

Assess whether the query is clear enough to investigate, or if clarification would produce better results. Consider:
- Is the scope clear? (specific sites, all sites, a region?)
- Is the time frame clear? (recent, historical, trending?)
- Is the metric/domain clear? (data quality, enrollment, both?)
- Would a reasonable clinical operations professional understand the intent?

Produce a JSON assessment:
{{
  "needs_clarification": true/false,
  "clarification_questions": ["question1", "question2"],
  "assumed_interpretation": "What we assume the user means if we proceed without clarification",
  "confidence_in_assumption": 0.0-1.0
}}
