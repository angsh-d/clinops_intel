Identify sites with worsening entry lag trends, high query burden, or monitoring gaps that suggest hidden data quality debt. Specifically investigate:

1. Which sites have eCRF entry lags exceeding 5 days and whether the trend is worsening?
2. Which sites have an open query count above 15, and what is the query aging distribution?
3. Are there sites where CRA monitoring visits are overdue or where CRA transitions have disrupted data review cadence?
4. Which sites show a pattern of increasing data corrections that may indicate systematic entry errors?

Focus on identifying the root cause of any data quality degradation — is it a staffing issue, a process gap, or a site capability problem?
