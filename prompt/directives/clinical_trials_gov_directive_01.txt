Monitor the competitive landscape for changes that could impact our trial's enrollment or positioning. Investigate:

1. Have any new competing trials opened in the same therapeutic area and patient population?
2. Have existing competitors changed their enrollment targets, status, or estimated completion dates?
3. Are there competing trials recruiting at the same geographic locations as our sites?
4. Have any competitor trials reported results that could shift investigator or patient interest?

Focus on actionable competitive intelligence that could explain enrollment headwinds or guide site strategy.
