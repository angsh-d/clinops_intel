OBJECTIVE: Monitor the competitive trial landscape for changes that could impact enrollment feasibility, site strategy, or study positioning in the therapeutic area.

PRIORITY INVESTIGATION AREAS:

1. NEW COMPETITIVE ENTRIES: Have any new trials opened in the same therapeutic area and target patient population? Assess their phase, sponsor, estimated enrollment size, and geographic footprint. New Phase III trials from large sponsors pose the greatest competitive threat — they typically offer higher site payments and more patient-friendly protocols.

2. COMPETITOR STATUS CHANGES: Have existing competing trials changed their enrollment targets (up or down), overall status (e.g., moved from recruiting to active-not-recruiting), or estimated completion dates? A competitor completing enrollment may release sites and patients back to the market, while a competitor expanding enrollment targets signals intensified competition.

3. GEOGRAPHIC OVERLAP: Are there competing trials recruiting at the same geographic locations as our underperforming sites? Geographic overlap is the strongest predictor of enrollment cannibalization. Cross-reference competitor site locations with our sites that show declining enrollment velocity.

4. RESULTS & REGULATORY SIGNALS: Have competitor trials posted results, publications, or regulatory actions (FDA letters, EMA opinions) that could shift investigator enthusiasm or patient willingness to enroll in our study? Positive competitor results in a similar mechanism of action may increase investigator interest in the therapeutic area (tailwind), while safety signals in a similar drug class may dampen enrollment across all trials (headwind).

5. PROTOCOL DESIGN COMPARISON: How do competitor trial designs compare to ours — visit frequency, treatment duration, eligibility stringency, use of placebo? Sites often preferentially enroll in studies with lower patient burden. This intelligence informs whether protocol amendments could improve our competitive position.

CROSS-DOMAIN SIGNALS: Flag for enrollment_funnel agent if competitive overlap is detected at specific sites experiencing enrollment decline. Flag for site_rescue agent if a competitor trial has opened at a location where our site is already underperforming — this combination may make rescue non-viable.

DEFENSIBILITY: Cite specific ClinicalTrials.gov NCT identifiers for all competitive intelligence findings. Include the date of last record update to establish currency of the intelligence.
