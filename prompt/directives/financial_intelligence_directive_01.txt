Identify budget overruns, cost-per-patient anomalies, and burn rate projection risks. Investigate:

1. Which budget categories show variance exceeding 10% from plan, and what is driving the overrun?
2. What is the current cost-per-patient compared to budget, and which sites have the highest cost-per-patient?
3. At the current burn rate, when will the budget be exhausted relative to the planned study timeline?
4. Are there change orders or scope changes that are driving unplanned costs?

Focus on identifying financial risks that could impact study completion and whether corrective financial actions are needed.
