Analyze the enrollment pipeline across all sites to detect velocity drops, screen failure spikes, and consent withdrawal patterns. Investigate:

1. Which sites have enrollment velocity below target, and is the gap widening or narrowing?
2. Are there sites with screen failure rates above 40%, and what are the primary exclusion criteria driving failures?
3. Are consent withdrawal rates elevated at any sites, and do they correlate with specific protocol amendments or operational changes?
4. Are there sites with kit inventory shortfalls that could bottleneck upcoming randomizations?

Identify whether enrollment issues are site-specific operational problems or study-wide protocol challenges.
