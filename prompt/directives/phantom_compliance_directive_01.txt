Flag sites showing suspiciously low variance across multiple data quality domains that may indicate fabrication or rubber-stamping. Investigate:

1. Which sites show near-zero variance in eCRF entry lag, query resolution time, or data correction rates — suggesting manufactured compliance?
2. Are there sites where CRA monitoring reviews show uniform pass rates across all domains — suggesting rubber-stamping rather than genuine source data verification?
3. Do any sites show weekday-only data entry patterns with no weekend or holiday entries, inconsistent with genuine clinical workflows?
4. Are there sites where query resolution times cluster suspiciously around specific thresholds?

Distinguish between genuinely high-performing sites and sites showing statistical patterns inconsistent with real clinical operations.
