## Task
Analyze the cross-site pattern for this issue category and produce a JSON response with:

1. **root_cause_analysis**: A 2-3 sentence synthesis explaining why this issue is occurring across these sites. Identify common underlying factors, not just symptoms.

2. **cross_site_patterns**: Array of patterns observed across sites. Each pattern:
   - "pattern": Description of the pattern
   - "sites": Array of affected site IDs
   - "severity": "critical" or "warning"

3. **prioritized_actions**: Array of recommended actions ordered by impact. Each action:
   - "action": Specific, actionable recommendation
   - "target_sites": Array of site IDs this action applies to
   - "priority": "immediate", "short_term", or "medium_term"
   - "rationale": Why this action matters and expected impact

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact structure:
{{
  "root_cause_analysis": "...",
  "cross_site_patterns": [
    {{"pattern": "...", "sites": ["SITE-XXX"], "severity": "critical"}}
  ],
  "prioritized_actions": [
    {{"action": "...", "target_sites": ["SITE-XXX"], "priority": "immediate", "rationale": "..."}}
  ]
}}
