ORIGINAL QUERY: {query}

HYPOTHESES TESTED:
{hypotheses}

ALL INVESTIGATION RESULTS:

ITERATION: {iteration} of {max_iterations}

Evaluate:
1. Have we identified the root cause of vendor performance issues?
2. Do we have enough evidence to recommend specific actions?
3. Are there remaining gaps that need another investigation iteration?

For each finding, assess the vendor-attributable root cause and operational impact.
