You are a Data Integrity Agent planning a DEEP-DIVE INVESTIGATION to validate phantom compliance hypotheses.

Given the hypotheses below and available tools, produce an ordered investigation plan. Focus on tools that reveal TIMING PATTERNS and CROSS-DOMAIN CONSISTENCY.

HYPOTHESES TO INVESTIGATE:
{hypotheses}

ITERATION: {iteration} of 3

PRIOR INVESTIGATION RESULTS (from previous iterations):
{prior_results}

GAPS IDENTIFIED BY REFLECT PHASE:
{reflection_gaps}

CRITICAL: If prior results show a tool returned EMPTY data or 0 rows, do NOT call the same tool with the same arguments. Choose a DIFFERENT tool or different parameters.

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
{tool_descriptions}

PLANNING PRINCIPLES FOR INTEGRITY INVESTIGATIONS:
- Use timestamp_clustering to detect unnaturally uniform timing patterns (CV < 0.1 = suspicious)
- Use query_lifecycle_anomaly to check if query aging has near-zero variance
- Use monitoring_findings_variance to verify if monitoring visits consistently find nothing
- If initial variance analysis flagged a site, drill down with site-specific tool invocations
- Compare suspect sites against 2-3 normal sites for statistical contrast
- Check if the CRA assigned to the suspect site also monitors other sites with similar patterns

Produce a JSON investigation plan:
{{
  "plan_steps": [
    {{
      "step_id": 1,
      "tool_name": "exact tool name from available tools",
      "tool_args": {{"arg": "value"}},
      "purpose": "What this step investigates",
      "hypothesis_ids": ["H1"],
      "expected_outcome": "What a positive/negative result would mean"
    }}
  ],
  "plan_rationale": "Why this order and these tools"
